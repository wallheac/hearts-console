Console implementation of a Hearts card game

## Notes on this version
Getting a better grip on MVP patterns.

### What Went Well
1. Got a little better at driving behavior with tests
2. Code got significantly simpler

### What Needs Improvement
1. Need to handle passing cards at the start of each round
2. Need to handle a variable number of players
3. There's still some simplification that can take place. Continuing to work on my refactoring skills.

### Next Steps
1. Replace Console with GUI, probably Swing or JavaFX
2. Stretch goal: reimplement in Kotlin
